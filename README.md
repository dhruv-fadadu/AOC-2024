****Advent of Code 2024 Solutions****
Welcome to my repository for Advent of Code 2024! ðŸŽ„

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual event where developers from around the world come together to solve daily programming challenges throughout the month of December. Each day, a new puzzle is released, and participants are challenged to find creative solutions to a wide variety of problems.

This repository contains my solutions to all the challenges from Advent of Code 2024. Each day's puzzle has its own directory with code written in Python.

**Features**
- Solutions for each day, starting from Day 1 to Day 25.
- Code written in Python.
- Step-by-step breakdowns for difficult problems (where applicable).
- Optimizations and performance improvements for challenging tasks.

**Structure**
- Each dayâ€™s solution is contained within its own folder (day01, day02, ... day25).
- The main code for each challenge is in the respective day's file, such as main.py or solution.js.
- Some days may include additional files, like input files or helper functions, depending on the problem.


**Contributing**
Feel free to fork the repository and contribute your own solutions or improvements. If you find bugs or have suggestions, please open an issue.

Happy coding and good luck solving the challenges! ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„
